Some chase forever dreaming
Some never find the feeling
Some never know what to believe
My heart is like a diamond
So rare but you find it
Don't need no other company
The way you make me feel I can't describe
Let's go somewhere and leave the world behind
We can never change what is meant to be
We'll follow thе stars wherever thеy lead
Love can be so sweet like a symphony
But here and now with you is destiny
Na, na, na, na, na (everyday, yeah, habibi)
Na, na, na, na, na (me and you, yeah, habibi)
Na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na (everyday, yeah, habibi)
Na, na, na, na, na (me and you, yeah, habibi)
Na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na
Somehow we go the distance
We are one in a million
You hold me down when I am weak
We're in this thing together
Nobody knows me better
I'll be there for you in the sea
The way you make me feel I can't describe
Let's go somewhere and leave the world behind
We can never change what is meant to be
We'll follow the stars wherever they lead
Love can be so sweet like a symphony
But here and now with you is destiny
Na, na, na, na, na (everyday, yeah, habibi)
Na, na, na, na, na (me and you, yeah, habibi)
Na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na (everyday, yeah, habibi)
Na, na, na, na, na (me and you, yeah, habibi)
Na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na
when I have you close
(Habibi) life is beautiful
(Habibi) they say that love will last forever
We can never change what is meant to be
We'll follow the stars wherever they lead
Love can be so sweet like a symphony
But here and now with you is destiny
Na, na, na, na, na (everyday, yeah, habibi)
Na, na, na, na, na (me and you, yeah, habibi)
Na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na (everyday, yeah, habibi)
Na, na, na, na, na (me and you, yeah, habibi)
Na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na
